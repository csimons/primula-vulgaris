primula-vulgaris
================

Fork of Jaeger's Primula system for probabilistic-relational modeling.

http://people.cs.aau.dk/~jaeger/Primula/

The initial goal for this project is not to take Primula a new direction, but
to establish a repository that is amenable to pulling down from any system
and rapidly building, developing, and testing, so that contributions to this
project can more easily be made.  At the time of this writing, the existing
Primula source distribution has external dependencies that need to be
procured separately, and has no existing build system or scripts.

Once the initial goal has been met, new branches will be used to develop
experimental features with the ultimate intention of contributing them back
to the original project.
